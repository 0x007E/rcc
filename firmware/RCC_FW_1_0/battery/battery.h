 * @brief Battery monitoring interface for AVR microcontrollers.
 *
 * This header file defines the interface for battery status monitoring using an ADC channel. It provides macros to configure ADC channel and battery empty threshold, a status enumeration, and function prototypes to initialize battery measurement and retrieve battery status.
